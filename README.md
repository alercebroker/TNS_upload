Tools to upload young SN candidates to TNS. Please clone this repository to access the notebooks below.

* The [ALeRCE TNS send notebook](https://github.com/alercebroker/TNS_upload/blob/master/ALeRCE_ZTF_TNS_send_SNe.ipynb) is used to select host galaxies, prepare a report and send to TNS

* The [ALeRCE TNS analysis notebook](https://github.com/alercebroker/TNS_upload/blob/master/ALeRCE_ZTF_TNS_analysis.ipynb) is used to gather statistics about the candidates sent to TNS

* An alerce_tns object is created in [lib/alerce_tns.py](https://github.com/alercebroker/TNS_upload/blob/master/lib/alerce_tns.py)

* The daily candidates are saved in the [candidates](https://github.com/alercebroker/TNS_upload/tree/master/candidates) directory
Use with caution. Note that a TNS API key file is needed for some of the notebooks.
